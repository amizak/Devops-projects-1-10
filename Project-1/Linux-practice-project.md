# LINUX PRACTICE PROJECTS
## Introduction to Linux and Basic Commands 
## Pre-requisites: I spinned up an Ec2 instance and my virtual server is Ubuntu
## A Linux command is a program or utility that runs on the command line interface - a console that interacts with the system via texts and processes.
## Note: All Linux commands are case-sensitive.
## File manipulation
##### Command: sudo apt update.

##### Command: sudo apt upgrade. 
###### I ran this command to upgrade the installed packages on my Ubuntu Linux server. This was done to ensure that my system has the latest bugs fixed, security updates and feature improvements of the software.

##### Command: pwd.
###### meaning print current working directory, this command was ran to find the path of the current/present workingdirectory.
##### Command: cd
###### This command was used to change into a directory. To navigate through the linux files and directories, the command cd is used. Depending on your current working directory, it requires either a full path or the directory name. However running this command without an option will take you to the home folder, using the cd - moves to your previous directory and cd .. moves you one directory up.
##### Command: ls
###### The ls command lists files and directories within a system. Running it without a flag will show the current working directory's content. To see other directories' content, i used ls followed by the desired path.

###### using ls with the option -R lists all the files in the subdirectories.

###### using ls with  the option -a shows hidden files in addition to the visible ones

###### using ls with the option -lh shows the file size in easily readable formats, such as KB,MB,GB and TB
