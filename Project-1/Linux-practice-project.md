# LINUX PRACTICE PROJECTS
## Introduction to Linux and Basic Commands 
## Pre-requisites: I spinned up an Ec2 instance and my virtual server is Ubuntu
## A Linux command is a program or utility that runs on the command line interface - a console that interacts with the system via texts and processes.
## Note: All Linux commands are case-sensitive.
## Task 1: File manipulation
##### Command: sudo apt upgrade. 
##### I ran this command to upgrade the installed packages on my Ubuntu Linux server. This was done to ensure that my sytem has the latest bugs fixed, security updates and feature improvements of the software.
